## Post Option 1 (Technical Focus)

**Just shipped: watsonx MCP Server** 🚀

I built a Model Context Protocol server that lets Claude delegate tasks to IBM watsonx.ai foundation models.

**The result?** A two-agent AI system where Claude (Opus 4.5) handles complex reasoning while delegating specific workloads to Granite, Llama 3, and Mistral models.

**What it does:**
• `watsonx_generate` - Text generation with enterprise models
• `watsonx_chat` - Multi-turn conversations
• `watsonx_embeddings` - Vector embeddings for RAG pipelines
• `watsonx_list_models` - Model discovery

**Why it matters:**
→ Cost optimization by routing to smaller models
→ Enterprise compliance with IBM infrastructure
→ Specialized model capabilities (Granite for enterprise, Llama for reasoning)
→ Embedding generation for semantic search

Built with Node.js, the @IBM watsonx-ai SDK, and the MCP protocol.

This is what multi-agent AI looks like in practice—not replacing models, but orchestrating them.

## Post Option 2 (Narrative Focus)

**What if Claude could talk to other AI models?**

That's exactly what I built.

The watsonx MCP Server creates a bridge between Claude and IBM's foundation models. Now when I'm working in Claude Code, it can:

✅ Delegate text generation to IBM Granite models
✅ Generate embeddings with Slate for RAG pipelines
✅ Use Llama 3 70B for specific reasoning tasks
✅ Route to cost-effective models for simple tasks

**The architecture is simple:**
Claude (primary agent) → MCP Server → watsonx.ai API → Foundation Models

**The implications are profound:**
This isn't just API integration. It's the beginning of AI systems that can intelligently select which model to use for which task.

Claude handles the orchestration. Watson handles the specialized workloads.

The future of AI isn't one model to rule them all—it's intelligent orchestration.

## Post Option 3 (Short & Punchy)

**New drop: watsonx MCP Server** ⚡

Claude can now delegate tasks to IBM watsonx.ai.

Two agents. One workflow. Infinite possibilities.

→ Text generation with Granite & Llama
→ Embeddings for RAG
→ Model-specific routing
→ Enterprise compliance

Demo: https://purplesquirrelmedia.github.io/watsonx-mcp-server/
Code: https://github.com/PurpleSquirrelMedia/watsonx-mcp-server

This is the future of AI development—not choosing between models, but orchestrating them.
